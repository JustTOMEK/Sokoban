Map txt files are x lines and y signs with spaces <br />
Line should end with enter <br />
A map has to be rectangle, so every line has to have equal number of signs <br />
Rules:
    -w: wall
    -p: player
    -b: box
    -f: floor
If letter is capital then target is on this tile <br />
If you add a new map the file name has to be in format map_{level_number}.txt <br />
level_numbers have to be one after another <br />
so levels 1 2 3 4 5 are legal <br />
levels 1 2 4 5 are not legal
